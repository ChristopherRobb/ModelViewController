#ModelViewController
MVC- Model View Controller Design Pattern


MVC with Servlets and JSP Integrated together. 


Servlet will handle the business logic  and JSP will handle the VIEW.

•	Web browser sends in request to the Controller(servlet) to hold the business logic. 

•	Calls the (MODEL) to get information using ARRAY (database optional).

•	Sends back to VIEW (JSP Page) then back to web browser.
